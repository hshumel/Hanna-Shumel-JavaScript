The given bracket sequence is: [((())()(())]]

To check if it is correct, we need to see if every opening bracket has a matching closing bracket.
The sequence is not correct as given, because the number of opening and closing brackets is not balanced.

This can be fixed by:
1. Replacing the pre-last closing square bracket with a closing round bracket: [((())()(()))].
2. Adding an opening square bracket to the beginning and adding a closing round bracket before the pre-last closing square bracket: [[((())()(()))]].
